!!!! NOTE !!!!<br>
This is PYTHON code written to work in codeskulptor, w'll work in PYTHON 2.X after some changes<br>

<p>
The goal of this Module is to get started with simple, yet 
central, concepts in graph theory, simple principles of 
discrete probability, and a light version of hypothesis
testing.
</p>
<p>
There are three short functions below:<br>
- create undirected dictionaries corresponding to some simple examples of graphs.<br>
- compute information about the the in-degrees for nodes in these graphs.<br>
- compute information about the distribution of the in-degrees for nodes in these graphs.
